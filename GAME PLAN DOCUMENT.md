1\. Game Concept



This project is a simple 3D action game involving a player character and an enemy character. The main objective of the player is to collect bones (collectibles) and use them as a weapon to attack and defeat the enemy. When the player successfully kills the enemy, the player regains health as a reward. The enemy continuously patrols and chases the player when the player enters its detection area. If the player moves quickly and exits the enemy’s chase radius (circular area), the enemy will stop chasing and return to its original position.

* Collect bones scattered in the game environment
* Attack the enemy using the collected bones

* Return to Origin – Go back to the original position if the player escapes the chase area



4\. Common Gameplay Mechanics



* Both the player and the enemy have a health bar
* When the player’s health bar reaches zero, the player dies and the game ends
